# Java Client for the Homematic IP Cloud

A Java wrapper for the RESP API of the Homematic IP Cloud.
Since there is no offical documentation i used the code of the [Python wrapper](https://github.com/coreGreenberet/homematicip-rest-api)
to get an idea of how the API works. Thanks to [coreGreenberet](https://github.com/coreGreenberet) for doing the great job of
reverse engineering. **Use this library at your own risk!**
